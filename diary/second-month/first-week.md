# Diary of my apprenticeship at Craftsmen
## Second period
### 1st week

#### Back to work
I came back this week to Saint-Étienne for my second period of work at Craftsmen. I must say I was a little stressed out because my school time was really dense as you can see on [the Tumblr](http://histoire-sensible.tumblr.com) I made to show my progressive reflexion on my essay. What if I had forget about what I learned during my first period at Craftsmen? However, I quickly had the confirmation it wasn't the case. Monday morning, I spent a few time to get to know my new mentor, [Kévin](https://github.com/kevcha) then [Mehdi](https://github.com/mehlah) requested me to work on the mobile version of [the Saint-Étienne Rails Girls event](http://railsgirls.webenvert.fr). I worked on this for the whole day, taking the time to discover how the files were organized, then branching to start the mobile version and finally [committing and pull requesting it on github](https://github.com/craftsmen/railsgirls-saintetienne/pull/2#issuecomment-143978220)!
I was reassured I managed to find my way and to make it in one day :)
Now I'm still waiting after Mehdi's review ^^

#### CSS forever

On Tuesday, [Kévin](https://github.com/kevcha) asked me to focus rather on my monthly goal, which is to keep going on with CSS. Therefore I continued [Treehouse CSS beyond the basic course](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/css-beyond-the-basics#css-animation-basics), starting to get familiar with Transformation, Transition and Animation CSS properties. During the week, I completed my learning with [Treehouse CSS animation with SVG course](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/css-beyond-the-basics#css-animation-basics). As an After Effect experienced user, I was surprised by CSS possibilities in terms of animation. I look forward to use them on a project.

Also I took another Treehouse courses on my spare time during the week, which was [Treehouse design foundation course](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/design-foundations). Indeed I was curious to see how Treehouse staff was going to handle a design course, as I think it's more complicated than a course about coding. I must say, I was deceived. I expected something more heavy, less superficial. But this is probably because I've been learning design for 5 years now.

#### My first design sprint

From Wednesday to Thursday, we welcomed [Subleem team](https://www.subleem.com) to work on a project of IOS application. For two days, we used the [Design Sprint Method](https://developers.google.com/design-sprint/downloads/DesignSprintMethods.pdf). The Craftsmen already told me about this method during my first period at Saint-Étienne and I was really enthusiastic to make my first one.
Indeed, I found the first day was exhausting. It was a lot of questioning, listening and thinking to understand Subleem business and expectations for the app. I was a **recorder** so I had to keep focus on everything that was said.
The second day was more relaxed and creative : by the end of the sprint, we made a sketched prototype that allow the team to share the same vision of the future app.
I found the method very interesting. However, I noticed some weak points that I wish to improve in the workflow and the process of recording and sharing notes.

#### Breakable toy

Since I started to read [Apprenticeship Pattern](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001813/index.html), I was looking for a breakable toy idea that could be useful to Craftsmen and diverse enough to make me practice interface design, front-end development, Arduino and a little bit of back-end. Taking part into a design sprint and observing some weak points gave me the idea to develop a tool to help having a great design sprint experience for both clients and organizers. I shared the idea with my mentor to make a breakable toy made of small projects, one for each month. He didn't seem against, but he warned about the novelty of the method. I may start this project once my blog will be launched. While waiting, I started reading a few documentation about the subject including [Google venture article](http://www.gv.com/sprint/) and [Thoughbot design sprint documentation on Github](https://github.com/thoughtbot/design-sprint). Watch this space.

#### Current readings

Outside [Apprenticeship Pattern](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001813/index.html), I started documented myself about [Material design](https://www.google.com/design/spec/what-is-material/material-properties.html#). I've heard about this in an episode of [The Walking Web](http://www.thewalkingweb.fr) while I was in Poland last month. I have to say, I'm getting more and more curious about design for the Web. During the design sprint, we discussed the shapes of forms of on the web. How to built an attractive form that won't be perceived as an inquisition? Therefore I searched for a few articles dealing with it. Here's two that I will keep in mind for forms design :
* [Built an awesome form on Medium](https://medium.com/@kubachrzecijanek/how-to-build-an-awesome-form-1e9b2c1bd00d)
* [Epic form and input field design trends on Medium](https://medium.com/@saijogeorge/creative-form-input-field-design-examples-bfe5dd50808a)

#### Personality :

During the first period at Craftsmen, [Kévin](https://github.com/kevcha) told me about a conference they intended that was amazing : [Giles Colborne - Delight and Innovation conference at UX Lausanne](https://vimeo.com/98204333). I haven't seen it yet. But if it is has great as [Kévin](https://github.com/kevcha) said, I intend to make my own inquiries on Giles Colborne that I honestly never heard about before. I also discovered
[Mark Boulton blog](http://www.markboulton.co.uk). I plan to deep into his article next week, particularly those about the grid, and Gridset.

** See you next week :) **
