# Diary of my apprenticeship at Craftsmen
## Second period
### 5th week

#### Go! Go! Rails Girls

I forgot to tell you about last Friday. Craftsmen hosted an event called [RailsGirls](http://railsgirls.com). I helped my mentors to prepare the event the whole Friday. The event started at 7pm. 47 women came :) For this evening we only set up girls computers. The next day, I was hesitating between taking part into the Rails Girls as a participant or as an advisor. I did a little bit of both indeed. I helped girls who were showing interest for HTML and CSS and I followed [the tutorial](http://guides.railsgirls.com/app/). But I wasn't focus enough on the tutorial to dive into Rails. Therefore, I took some time the next Monday and Tuesday to work on my new breakable toy : an app to recommend movies for Craftsmen's members. I quickly built up a navigation bar and even found solutions to implement CSS classes into Ruby element. It might look like a poor accomplishment from the outside, but for me it confirmed that I fulfilled the goal I gave myself a month ago : be more independent.

#### (re)design

The end of the week was dedicated to the redesign of a web application that Craftsmen made years ago for a printing company. I paired with Mehdi during all that time. He showed me the steps he usually takes to design an app, how he generates a living style guide and how to juggle between the app interface and the living style guide to iterate on the design. The experience was kind of exciting : making my first proposals by pushing branches into a real project, discussing my proposals with the other members of the team, even merging my first branches! It made me feel like a part of the team and I like it.

#### Stay focus!

On Friday evening, we met to make the assessment of my second period at Craftsmen. I think my progress goes hand in hand with what Mehdi and KÃ©vin expected. I feel more at ease with coding. However, I noticed that I should work on my ability to stay focus even more when I'm pairing. I found it hard to listen and think at the same time while pairing with Mehdi on our project. Also, I need more practice to get good habits especially on code logic and refactoring. Anyway, can't wait to come back to Craftsmen. To be continued...
