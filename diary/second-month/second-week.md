# Diary of my apprenticeship at Craftsmen
## Second period
### 2nd week

#### Practice, Practice, Practice

This week was mainly dedicated to the shipping of my blog. I start looking at Bourbon's documentation more seriously to try to take the best of it. I've never loved looking at code documentation before because code was just obscure to me. But now that I started to feel more comfortable with it, I find documentation quiet clear and easy to use. However, I relied a lot on my mentor's knowledge concerning the back-end. It made me feel ill-at-ease in a good way I guess, as it raised my interest for the role back-end plays in projects.

Also, I was really enthusiastic to use [modular-scale](http://www.modularscale.com/?1&em&1.618&web&text) for my blog layout. This tool allows you to use a ratio of your choice for every single thing that is measurable on your website. It helps me a lot to find a balance between all the graphical elements. Once again, I was surprised by code possibilities and feel like coding will help me to make better interfaces on the visual side.

#### My first contribution to a Craftsmen projects

As I said a week ago, I worked on a responsive version of the website [Rails Girls Saint-Etienne](http://railsgirls.webenvert.fr/). I paired with Mehdi this week in order to refactor my code. Pairing is definitely a good way to learn something new. This time, we tested the responsive version on several devices to see how the website renders on them. I discovered that even if it's a good tool, browsers demo on smartphone are just not enough to check if your code is working well.

After that, we shipped the responsive version of the site. I was proud I finally took part into a Craftsmen project.

#### Apprenticeship Pattern : Completed.

I also finished the book [Apprenticeship Pattern](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596518387.do). I enjoy discovering the way programmers imagine their work and how they tend to evolve through it. Somehow, I think any kind of profession that generate passion should follow the same pattern. Nonetheless, I don't agree with one of the section of this book, that is called "Craft over Art". I even wrote an article about it. I will soon release it on my blog and on Medium.
