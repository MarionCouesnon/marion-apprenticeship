# Diary of my apprenticeship at Craftsmen
## Second period
### 3rd week

#### Playing forger
This week, my main goal was to make a copy of Twitter's interface. First, it doesn't look very exciting. But I have to say, it was finally very enriching. I enjoyed understanding how the interface has been built, especially concerning the hover animation in the left navigation bar :)

Observing the interface also encourage me to retake [my basics in css positioning.](http://www.barelyfitz.com/screencast/html-training/css/positioning/) and made me understand even more the box model.

#### Optimize your workflow
I've also learned a lot in terms of workflow. As I started to go in the details with the navigation bar, KÃ©vin ask me to rather work on a general shape, a little bit like a UI sketch and then to focus on details by components.

He also advised me to make as many branches as needed. Basically I made one branch by component. Going back and forth between branches because I was stuck on something and wanted to work on something else before I counter-attack allowed me to understand the real benefit of branching.

#### Conclusion
By the end of the week, I completed the navigation bar, the profile dashboard and started the tweet area, but without finishing it. I was deceived about it. I guess I just need more practice to become faster at coding.

Also I should have iterate more on the CSS component, to built the interface in a more global way rather than focusing on a component until this one is ready to ship. I would have obtain a more homogeneous result.
