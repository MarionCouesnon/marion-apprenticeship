# Diary of my apprenticeship at Craftsmen
## Third period

### 1st week

#### The dumbfounded come back

Two weeks ago, I came back at Craftsmen. This is the last month of my "training" time apprenticeship. Meaning that at the end of this month, I should be able to handle a project from A to Z, concerning interface design. It may look frightening, but I feel that I will manage to reach my objectives. I had plenty of time to learn and even if I'll never stop really, I feel I'm ready for the next level. This is why I was so happy Mehdi put me on their current project for my first day. We were starting a product for a record label. However, I was told during the day that there are many questions about Craftsmen's future currently going on between Mehdi and Kévin and it hit me really bad. Nonetheless, I convinced myself the best I could do would be to give the best I have on projects.

#### How to start a project you know nothing about?

I started the project by trying to understand what was the needs. It's not as easy as you may imagine. Clients are always wishing to put as many features as possible in their product whereas the user wants to have an easy and simple life. Plus, I didn't know a thing about how record labels works, so I spend a day full-time in searching and digging my investigation. I made many lists and tables in every direction. I was alone at the office for the first time but each time I felt lost, I could have quick conversations on Slack with Kévin, which made me feel "on the right track".

#### Paper sketch and UX testing

The next day, I started sketching interfaces. It was a little bit chaotic. I was iterating each time I finished a sketch and then drawing another one before changing directions again. I tested a proposal on Kévin which allowed me to discover, I just lost the main objective! After two days however, I thought I managed to find something reliable. Then, we make another user test with Mehdi. As he worked on his side on the same interface, we wrote a couple of sentences to test each other interfaces. We exchanged our sentences and the user would have to do the actions written on pieces of paper. I remarked during this operation that Mehdi's interface was made of papers he cut out. So he could rearrange the interface really quickly. It makes me think about atomic design. I definitely should do the same thing next time. I won't waste that much time drawing again and again the same components when what bother me was the place they have rather than their nature in itself!

#### jQuery, finally.

Friday is dedicated to learning, open sourcing and personal projects at Craftsmen. This is why I started to learn about jQuery. I was curious about JavaScript since some times already. I used it a few on some projects and it sounded very exciting to me, but remained really obscure too. I was asking Kévin and Mehdi since two months if they think I could jump on that technology. Yet they always sounded mitigated about it. I understand why. I believe that if you want to use cleverly this technology, you have to be aware of how it works. I mean how Internet works. If you don't, you may make heavy-useless-ugly interface. And that would be a shame... Don't you think so?
