# One month in the head of a Craftsmen

## You will learn or you won't be

Isn't that strange to arrive in a new job and being welcomed by enthusiastic people and [gifts](https://twitter.com/craftsmenhq) they made for you? At least I've never experienced that before. It was rather something like : "Hello, now let's get started. Our current project is..." ending with a barely whispered "Thank you" at the end of the internship. But wait, it were internships. Not apprenticeships. Anyway, I wasn't expecting such a reception.

And it was just a start. As I read the first sentence of Craftsmen's welcome card, I look stunned at my mentor.

> "Your first three months are spent learning".

Three months ? But it's almost the half of the time I'm supposed to spend here. Do you really have the time to teach me things for three entire months ? Mehdi just gave a faint smile and advised me to read [Apprenticeship Patterns](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596518387.do) that was written by Dave Hoover and Adewale Oshineye.

Things started to look too good to be true. But I decided to ignore my pessimistic inner voice and to start learning. My first week was dedicated to [the console foundation, git and markdown](https://github.com/craftsmen/marion-apprenticeship/blob/master/goals/week_1.md). I knew the existence of the console before, but it was something that frighten me.

> According to me, the kind of people who were using the console were pale monsters with dark rings under their eyes typing compulsively things in their cave.

However I tried to overtake that silly clich√© and jumped into my apprenticeship. As days passes, I understood the benefits of using the console to the point it incensed me each time I have to open the desktop interface on my personal _windows_ computer. By the end of the week, I managed to complete my trail and started to read [The laws of simplicity](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262134721/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0262134721&linkCode=as2&tag=redesiglead03-20&linkId=VCENF5MJ3OEBGHBL) by John Maeda, which sounds accurate since I was starting to have a brand new look on my work as a designer.

During the second week, I threw myself in [HTML and CSS](https://github.com/craftsmen/marion-apprenticeship/blob/master/goals/week_2.md). Contrary to the console, I already made a few projects with those languages. Basically, I was interested in doing my apprenticeship at Craftsmen because I knew I was going to learn more about front-end development. Actually the first week focused on HTML and CSS was _kind of boring_, as I retake basics I thought I already knew. I learned a few elements I haven't seen before but this is it. By the end of the week, I started feeling like I need _practising_. However, something was still holding me back. This week was also the one when I started wondering questions such as : "What is a UX unicorn?" or "Should designer code?". I had many conversations with my mentor about those problematics that leads me to better understand Craftsmen DNA... And take the decision to write a blog where I will share all the questions I was wondering <!--- Blog's link here--->.

The third week was the mind blowing one and this at different level. First I understood essentials basics about HTML elements thanks to the fundamental chapter of [Dive Into HTML5](http://diveintohtml5.info/semantics.html). Also I started to catch on the way of thinking of CSS that made me understand I was just a toddler before. [My objectives](https://github.com/craftsmen/marion-apprenticeship/blob/master/goals/week_3.md) hadn't changed much because one week was just not enough to get it.

> For the first time I saw coding as a very human practice, a kind of language psychology. But also an entertaining community of passionate and helpful people.

Unfortunately, my brain started melting for perceiving things that exceed its abilities yet when I discover Scss features. It was time for me to start practicing.

## Practicing is the best thing

Step by step I built a first structure for my blog. I iterate on it several times, to make it more readable, understandable, sustainable. Sustainability sounds like a huge thing in a world where technologies evolve so fast. Mehdi helped me deploying it on Middleman by the end of the fourth week. This part was really obscure to me. And yet I haven't upload the website so I don't know if it will work.
> But it was great to see how coding can improve your design process.  

I also took part into pairing. Pairing is an interesting and very unusual conception of work. You associate yourself with some college and you exchange a lot together while building your product. I made it twice. First time was with my mentor on a current project. It allows me to discover some CSS tricks but more important to understand craftsmen workflow.
The second time was with another craftsmen apprentice. It was both rewarding and reassuring to work with another "newbie".

For now I've only been working on an annual project called "design to business" but rather to exercice myself than to have a real impact on the project. Responsabilities are scary but they also allow you to go beyond your expectations. I'm aware that I should have getting real earlier. This is why I expect to work much more on project when I'll come back by the end of September than I did for this period.

## Smiling on my way to office

As a result I find myself smiling on my way to the office every morning. You may think I'm naive to think it's gonna last because it's only the first month after all. Well, maybe I am. But at least it's a good start. At worst, it's an illusion that's going to fade away. At best I find a place. Anyway, I'm enjoying being at Craftsmen and learning so much things everyday. That's all matter.
