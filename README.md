# Fears
## Overall
 I'm afraid about not making graphic design during my Apprenticeship as craftsmen methodology sounds very different from classical agency way of working. I want to know how to code. But I also want to achieve my education through cutting-edge production.

 Also I'm afraid about what I should be considered like when I'll end my education. How should I call myself ? A UX Designer ? A Graphic one ? Or a Coder ?

### 1. Code :
- I'm afraid of not being as fast as I should with the program.
- I'm afraid about forgetting what I've learned as fast as I was taught about.
- I'm afraid of not being credible as a coder in front of developers. Thanks god, I know how to play with my silly-girl image to learn tips from those guys.

### 2. Design :
- I'm afraid of not being considered as a graphic Designer
- I'm afraid about starting to work on a project and being inefficient for graphic design purposes. Or worst being bad.
