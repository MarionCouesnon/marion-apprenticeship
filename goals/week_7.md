During this 7th week, it’s time to ship something. By the end of the week, your blog should be online. It doesn’t need to be “stylished”, but content should be here, easily readable and understandable.
You should at least explore two ways of showing content in different branches, and deploy the one you think is most relevant.
You also should end reading apprenticeship patterns book.

The main goals are:
- [ ] Ship a first version of your blog
- [ ] Get used to Neat grid & bourbon mixins in a concrete project
- [ ] Use Git commands, create branches & pull requests
- [ ] Understand & follow Craftsmen's Sass guidelines
- [ ] Finish reading apprenticeship patterns
