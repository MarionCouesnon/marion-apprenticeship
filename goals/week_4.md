This 4th week is the continuation of the previous one. We'll mainly cover
Sass basics, and continue practicing building web pages and pairing on client
projects.

The goals are:

- [x] Create and use mixins.
- [x] Set and use variables.
- [x] Use nested selectors.
- [x] Use `@include` and `@extend`.
- [ ] Understand [Craftsmen's Sass guidelines](https://github.com/craftsmen/guides/tree/master/style#sass)
