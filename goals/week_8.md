This week's focus is about practicing Sass by rebuilding from scratch a real world UI. Let's pick Twitter!
It will let you practice grids, organize Sass files on a larger project than what you are used to, splitting those as components.
You'll realize that nothing in this UI is very fancy. It appears unexceptional. It doesn’t show off. It doesn’t push your technical skills to the limit. It doesn’t reflect the latest trends.
Great designs achieve their goals and nothing else. They’re not flashy for the sake of being flashy, and they don’t conform for the sake of conforming. Great designs know what they’re for. They have a sense of purpose, they serve it well, and they know what doesn’t belong.

The main goals are:
- [ ] Build a copy of Twitter interface (only HTML / CSS, no JavaScript)
- [ ] Pratice git branches when building twitter UI and create Pull Requests
