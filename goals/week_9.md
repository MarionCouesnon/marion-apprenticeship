> We're not designing pages, we're designing systems of components. â€” Stephen Hay

This is this 9th week focus alongside pairing on Marketiq project.

We've focused on designing Web pages for long time. But pixel perfection and designing
the same experience for all devices is not possible. Phones, tablets, and laptops
are not the same. Designing for today's Web doesn't mean just making things work
on iPhones, iPads, and Cinema Displays.

Instead of page-based designs. We need design systems. Lot of people have been
exploring design systems and the processes needed to design like this.
What are the building blocks of design? Things that go beyond typography and color choices.
What interaction components are important?
Those are the main questions we'll try to answer.

  discussion regarding style guides and where they fit into the design/development process. The whole episode and podcast is great though.)
