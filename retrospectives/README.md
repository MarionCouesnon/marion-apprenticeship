Every Friday, both the mentor and the apprentice meet for a retrospective.

The main goals are:

- Review with the apprentice what was worked on this week and their thoughts, feelings, and concerns.
- Review their goals and the rough plan for the week and make any adjustments necessary.
- Review the upcoming week and what the plan is
- Briefly recap the plan for the remaining time with you, make adjustments as necessary
