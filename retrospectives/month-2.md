# What were the goals ?
For this second sessions of 5 weeks, the mainly goals were :

- Practice HTML, CSS and Git, getting experience on how to write and organize files
- Keep Git commits "atomic", using `git commit --amend` and `git rebase` when needed
- Create independant branches for new exploration, new features, and creating pull requests to get a review
- Learn style guides and the philosophy behind it
- Understand differences between UI Frameworks like Twitter Boostrap or Zurb Foundation versus Bourbon
 

# What have been achieved
After a month at school, it was time to get back into code ! The first week was focusing on continuing TreeHouse's courses and practicing HTML and CSS, making [Web En Vert Rails Girls website](http://railsgirls.webenvert.fr/) mobile friendly using CSS breakpoints. We also get Marion involved in a 2 days Design Sprint for a new project.

Followed weeks were focused on shipping [a first version of her blog](http://marioncouesnon.github.io/the-unicorn-trail/), that should be refactored and improved regularly, finish reading [Apprenticeship Patterns](http://www.amazon.com/Apprenticeship-Patterns-Guidance-Aspiring-Craftsman/dp/0596518382), and starting [Getting Real](https://gettingreal.37signals.com/).

Then it was time to rebuild from scratch the Twitter interface. This exercice was nice to increase Marion's self-confidence about her HTML and CSS skills, but also to let her see by herself that Twitter UI is built upon a CSS grid, and made with idependants elements that can be considered as components.

This was a good introduction for the last 2 weeks, that were focused on introducing systems of components and practicing it in one of our project, building a style guide, rethinking and refactoring global layout and components.

# Assessment and guidance about what next steps I think Marion should take
Marion stayed in her sustainable pace, still with a great enthusiasm, in line with first 5 weeks.

She made progress on front end development, she used modular scale to have coherent and gracefull ratios between elements, and visual interfaces that she designed do the job well.
She understood how important is to consider the native behavior of browser, and why we should rely on it. She also understood what is gracefull disgradation and progressive enhancement, so she started to be more pragmatic on what we should use when building a new user interface.

She should now improve her skills on mastering her environment (her IDE, Git and CLI commands, keyboard shortcuts, etc.) to be more autonomous.

## Recording learnings
Marion wrote diaries almost every week with a lot of details. That's a really good thing, keep going on!

## Sharing learning
We talked on the first session to open source this repository. Marion didn't seem really enthusiast about that, but I think it would be really nice. Is there an evolution with some step back about that ?

## Pairing
It was difficult for me to pair with Marion since she's actually learning front end development, and I'm not the best person to teach her this. I tried to pair helping her to solve her problems, but I think I didn't go deep enough since I didn't want to give her bad advices.

Despite this, Marion paired with Mehdi times to times, and 3 days on the last week, when building a styleguide for Marketiq and writing a new UI and layout based on a common reflection on how the product would be used. I think this was a great experience, both for her and us. On my side, I liked that and I'm really satisfied with the new shipped interface that is way better than the one I designed alone.

## Readings
Marion wasn't really strict about that, she just finished Apprenticeship Patterns, but didn't really start Getting Real. She explained that she need time to read and understand what she's reading.
