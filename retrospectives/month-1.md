# What have been achieved

We covered various topics like the console, Git, HTML and markup semantics, CSS basics, box model and positioning, Sass basics. We tracked each week goals and achievement in plain Markdown files https://github.com/craftsmen/marion-apprenticeship/tree/master/goals.
We tweaked the trails when it seemed necessary based on Marion’s learning experience.

Marion acquired those concrete skills (among others):

- using the console for creating, copying, moving and deleting files and directories
- cloning a Git repo (or creating a new one)
- creating a new branch
- committing work and pushing to a remote
- writing semantic HTML markup
- using the browser web inspector
- using Sass variables
- using Bourbon mixins

# Assessment and guidance about what next steps I think Marion should take

Marion kept a sustainable pace of learning those first 5 weeks with a great enthusiasm.
She even made her way to open source by contributing to Bourbon’s docs.
Keep it going in the long term!

I’m concerned about the weaknesses on visual design, like grids usage.
I initially thought that Marion has a solid visual design foundation and have designed for the web.

## Recording learnings
We haven’t been very disciplined about recording learnings regularly and sharing those.
I think Marion should keep a weekly journal of the lessons learned as it makes the journey more explicit than checking weekly goals in a list.

## Sharing learning
We talked about the idea of making the repo where we track the progress public, but we let it go.
I’m still thinking that could be a very good thing to do.

## Pairing
I feel that we haven’t paired enough and early. I think the next month should be more focused on pairing.
A couple hours each day seems good.

It would essentially help for understanding some good practices, design processes, projects flows and working as a team.
How to write and organize Sass code, how to write good commit messages and avoiding `git commit -m "blabla"`,
how to balance between exploring designs, sketching, implementing a design, refining, ...

## Readings
During those first 5 weeks, we haven’t been very disciplined about books readings.
I think it might be better to pick one at a time from a reading list, and focus on it.
Apprenticeship Patterns and Getting Real were two important reads, but skipped.
