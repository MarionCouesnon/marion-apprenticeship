# Diary of my apprenticeship at Craftsmen
## Third period

### 2nd week

#### A guessing game

I spent most of my week learning jQuery and Javascript. Last Friday, Kévin explained to me how it works. He made it very well of course, but it's a lot of information and I didn't get enough time to memorize and understand everything. On Monday, he started asking me riddles. It was easy first, but it soon became hard and time consuming for Kévin. I always feel very uncomfortable when so. Although I'm more independent, I always feel a little bit afraid when starting to look at a new technology :( This is why I took the decision to look at (Threehouse Javascript basic course)[https://teamtreehouse.com/library/javascript-basics]. It allowed me to understand the basic syntax of this language, as well as its main properties (variables, functions but not loop yet!) Now I feel more confident to play with it. I want to try it out for a little project and also take Kévin's riddles again :)

#### My first weekly

On Friday, the three of them made a "weekly" : a short review of everyone weeks. It was the occasion for me to mention that I've been missing the record label project and interface design. However, I understood that someone need to start the project alone before we can gang up and iterate on different part of the design. I also mentioned that I felt a little bit lost about what I should do on Friday. I have many ideas, but I would like to make something that really helps Craftsmen. Mehdi answered that I don't need to ask each time I got an idea. I should rather make a draft and proposed it to them. It's nice he told me to do so. I always waist to much time wondering if I should do something or not!

#### What are you reading/watching/listenning to ?

During my time at school, I've read (Getting Real by Jason Fried and 37 Signals)[https://gettingreal.37signals.com]. It was really inspiring. I understand how it has an influence over Craftsmen's way of thinking. Since I came back, Mehdi asked me to read (The Lean Startup of Eric Ries)[https://itunes.apple.com/fr/book/lean-startup/id516858934?mt=11]. It's interesting but I feel it's a little bit far from me as it looks like a very pragmatic marketing approach. Also, I've watched (this talk)[https://vimeo.com/143971539] about UX designer. And I'm definitely crazy about Mike Monteiro. Each time this guy open his month, he sounds so confident and to have the benefit of hindsight. This is mind blowing. Since two months, I also regularly listen to Debbie Millman podcast: (Design Matters)[http://www.debbiemillman.com/designmatters/]. I found it very inspiring and reassuring about the future's unpredictability.

#### And maybe a talk coming on

Great news also! I may be talking at Web en Vert about code and design. I hope we will manage to organize it before Christmas. But most of all, I hope I will make people interested in my designer point of view, as people who gather at this conference are mainly part of the development world.
